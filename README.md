# OPP_Animals
In this project I use inheritance, singleton and dynamic cast. By accessing the interactive menu, animals with different properties can be added to the atlas in different collections: vertebrates (fish, reptiles, birds) and invertebrates. At each step there is the option to add a new animal with specific details or to display the entire collection.
